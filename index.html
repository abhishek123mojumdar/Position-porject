<!-- Default position of all html elements is static. This 
static position says that the html elements should foloow the 
normal document flow i.e child number1 should come first thene child 
number 2 and then child number 3 -->

<!-- relative position works almost like static position but it allows us to do a 
specific thing that static position does not i.e it helps to change the top 
left right and bottom of the element. (two posible ranges - +)
Relative helps us to change the element position , relative to the position where it would normally be
If we change the Top by some parameter, it would not push down the othe elements , as the 
elements are deatched from document flow.
 -->

<!-- absolute position removes the element from the document flow and makes it
independent . This positions it self relative to whole html document initially. 
To position it inside a particular DIV we need to make the parent div absolute 
or relative -->
